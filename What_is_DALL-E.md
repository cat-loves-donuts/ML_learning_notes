# What is DALL-E

## Test-to-image generation:
VQ-VAE still generate blur images, some feature still there but some detail places are fuzzy. Thus OpenAI tried to use transformer to deal with this problem.They trained a VQ-VAE in the first stage to get the feature of the image, and trained a autoregressive transformer to generate images.
