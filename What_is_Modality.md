## Modality

Each source or form of imformation could be called a modality. More generally, we could call 2 languages are 2 different modality or 2 data collected from different condition can also called 2 different Modality.

Thus, MultiModal Machine Learning (MMML), it aims to process and understand multi-source modal information through machine learning methods. Currently, a popular domain is multimodal learning among images, vedios, audios and semantics. The study of multimodal learning starts from 1970s and entered Deep Learning field since 2010.
